# News Classification Project

This project aims to classify news articles into various categories using a machine learning model. The model uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification, and the text data is processed using techniques such as TF-IDF for feature extraction.

## Features

- **Text Preprocessing:** The news articles are preprocessed to remove stopwords, perform tokenization, and convert text into vector format using TF-IDF.
- **Classification:** SVM is used to classify news articles into predefined categories such as business, technology, sports, politics, etc.
- **Real-time Classification:** Input news articles through a user interface and receive immediate classification results.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:**
  - Python (Flask for deploying the model)
  - Custom Model as SVM model
- **Frontend:**
  - React.js
- **Database:**
  - MongoDB for storing classified news articles and conversations
- **Authentication:**
  - Node.js for user authentication
- **Deployment:**
  - EC2 for cloud hosting
